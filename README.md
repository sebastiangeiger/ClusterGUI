*clustergui.html will not work in Chrome! You have been warned.*

##The proposed workflow is:
  - Use the prepare_files.rb script to generate folders for individual scenes from the cutfiles
     `./prepare_files.rb cuts/bbt_s01e01.cuts images/bbt_s01e01/*.png resized_s01e01`
  - Open clustergui.html. For every scene drag the images into the javascript app and save the cluster file, reload to start over.
